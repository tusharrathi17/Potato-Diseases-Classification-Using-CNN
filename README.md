Potatoes, one of the world's most crucial food crops, are an integral part of the global diet and 
agricultural economy. However, potato crops are vulnerable to a wide array of diseases, 
particularly those affecting the leaves, which can lead to substantial yield losses and reduced 
crop quality. Addressing these challenges effectively is critical for ensuring food security and 
the economic stability of millions of farmers worldwide. Traditionally, identifying and 
diagnosing potato leaf diseases has relied heavily on manual inspection by experts, a process 
that is both time-consuming and prone to human error. The advent of modern technologies, 
particularly in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning, offers new avenues to 
tackle these issues with greater accuracy and efficiency.
